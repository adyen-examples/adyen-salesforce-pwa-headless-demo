# Adyen Salesforce Composable Storefront (PWA) demo

This repository showcases an integration example of some features and capabilities of Adyen Payments integration with Salesforce Composable Storefront (PWA) for B2C Commerce.

## Before you begin

Before you start this demo, make sure that:

1. You have created an Adyen Test Account
2. You have a Salesforce sandbox connected to your Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC) instance. You can create an [on-demand sandbox](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/pwa-kit-managed-runtime/guide/creating-an-on-demand-sandbox.html).
3. You have set up your sites and [SLAS](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/commerce-api/guide/authorization-for-shopper-apis.html) for Composable Storefront.
4. You have set up and know where to find [configuration values for your local environment](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/pwa-kit-managed-runtime/guide/setting-up-your-local-environment.html#configuration-values).

## Run demo on local

You can run this demo on your local machine.

### Requirements:

-   Node v18 or later
-   npm v9 or later

### 1. Installation

```
    git clone https://github.com/adyen-examples/adyen-salesforce-pwa-headless-demo.git
```

### 2. Set the environment variables

1. Create a `./.env` file with your environment variables.

-   Copy the `./.env.example` file and rename the file to .env.

2. Set the variables in the .env file. Replace `YOUR_SITE_ID` in the variables with your Salesforce Site ID, this value is identical to the value you have for `COMMERCE_API_SITE_ID` f.e. `RefArch_ADYEN_API_KEY` where `RefArch` is your Site ID.

### 3. Configure allowed origins (CORS)

It is required to specify the domain or URL of the web applications that will make requests to Adyen.

In the Customer Area add `http://localhost:3000` to the list of Allowed Origins associated with the Client Key.

### 4. Run the application

```
    npm install
    npm run start
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to view storefront and make a test payment.

Try out the different payment methods with our [test card numbers](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/test-cards/test-card-numbers) and other payment method details.

## Webhook setup

In the Customer Area under the `Developers â†’ Webhooks` section, [create](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks/#set-up-webhooks-in-your-customer-area) a new `Standard webhook`.

A good practice is to set up basic authentication, copy the generated HMAC Key and set it as an environment variable. The application will use this to verify the [HMAC signatures](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks/verify-hmac-signatures/).

Make sure the webhook is **enabled**, so it can receive notifications.

### Expose an endpoint

This demo provides a simple webhook implementation exposed at `/api/webhooks/notifications` that shows you how to receive, validate and consume the webhook payload.

### Test your webhook

The following webhooks `events` should be enabled:

-   **AUTHORISATION**

To make sure that the Adyen platform can reach your application, we have written a [Webhooks Testing Guide](https://github.com/adyen-examples/.github/blob/main/pages/webhooks-testing.md)
that explores several options on how you can easily achieve this (e.g. running on localhost or cloud).
